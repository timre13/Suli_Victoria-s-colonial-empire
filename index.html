    <h1>Queen Victoria's British colonialism</h1>
    <h3>
      During Queen Victoria's reign, the British Empire expanded across the
      globe and strengthened its title as a world superpower. The main area of
      colonization for Britain was Africa, which had large amounts of resources
      that were not being utilized. Specifically, Britain focused on Egypt, West
      Africa, and South Africa during the nineteenth century. Quicker trade
      routes, cash crops, and global power were reasons for the quick
      colonization of these areas. Britain became the undeniable global power
      and the country experienced major economic growth. However, most people
      avoided or neglected to think about the effects that colonialism had on
      the African colonies.
    </h3>
    <h2>History of the Empire</h2>
    <p>
      The British Empire started expanding in the late 16th century when
      Elizabeth the Virgin Queen started engaging in Colonialism. One of the
      most important colonies, through its colonial charter company was the East
      India Company. When the industrial revolution came around the colonies
      could be sucked dry of their natural resources with total apathy. The
      industrial revolution of the 18th century had Britain in a head start and
      became the richest country for the next 2 centuries. The empire, by
      Victoria's time, was so huge that some part of it always had the sun and
      some part always had the moon on the sky at any given time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 19th century, Africa became a patchwork of European colonies.
      Although colonies like Liberia and Sierra Leone were founded by American
      and British abolitionists as homelands for freed slaves, colonies were
      mainly set up to exploit the natural resources of the African continent.
      The Boer War (1899-1902), pitted Britain against Boer colonists for the
      possession of the interior of South Africa. Less well known is the
      Ethiopian War (1895-1896) in which the native ruler, Menelik II
      (1889-1913), defeated an Italian army. Ethiopia was the only African state
      to remain free of direct colonial control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British Empire of the 19th century is best known for its queen,
      Victoria (1837-1901). In British North America, clashes with the United
      States during the War of 1812 and growing concerns about possible American
      annexation during the Civil War (1861-1865) led to the creation of the
      independent Dominion of Canada by Act of Confederation in 1867. Australia
      was still used as a British penal colony in the first half of the 19th
      century, but by 1868, shipments of convicts were replaced by free
      immigrants. In 1901, Australia became an independent commonwealth. Both
      Canada and Australia are still part of the British Commonwealth as of
      writing.
    </p>
    <h3>
      The decline of the British Empire started in the early part of the 20<sup
        >th</sup
      >
      century. The primary reason for Britain's colonial decline was the loss of
      supremacy with it's military and navy. After the second World War, Britain
      was no longer capable of financially supporting its empire as it now had,
      a legacy of debts and affording an Empire was no longer possible.
    </h3>
    <h2>Industrial society</h2>
    <p>
      Just like other industrial societies, British society saw remarkable
      changes during this period. The Victorian society was divided into the
      Lower, Woring, Middle, and Noble/Ruling classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cities of the working class saw poor and overcrowded accommodations which
      lacked sanitation and even the working condition was also unregulated and
      sometimes dangerous, while a new group, middle class, emerged that
      included factory owners, proprietors, and businessmen. Most of these men
      were hardworking and frugal, living in moderate luxuries accessible at
      that time. This class could read and write as well as afford to buy
      newspapers, magazines, books and novels. At the bottom of the society were
      people who were unemployed and lived in slums. Many turned out criminals
      like pickpockets, thieves and prostitutes.
    </p>
    <h2>The effects of Colonialism on literature and art</h2>
    <p>
      The great upsurge of imperial activity during the 19th century, though
      physically taking place in areas distant from British shores, had a broad
      impact on British culture. In the view of many critics, irrespective of
      the direct involvement of individual literary works with the colonial
      enterprise, the overall contours of Victorian literature are consistently
      shaped by the influence of colonial ideology, which informed the
      collective unconscious of the British public during the entire period and
      effects of it can still be perceived today, especially from Royalists and
      British nationalists, as well as certain radical political groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most obvious influence of colonialism on Victorian literature is
      evident in the colonial novels of writers like H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard
      Kipling, and Joseph Conrad. These novels are usually set in the distant
      lands that Britain colonized and attempt to expose the insular domestic
      public to the exotic strangeness of their country's colonial possessions.
      The reality of colonialism enters these texts as the necessary background
      that makes possible their narratives of adventure and romance. The linking
      of colonialism with the genre of the romantic adventure story is also
      evident in the abundant children's fiction of the time. While using
      Britain's colonial enterprise as the setting of their narratives, such
      novels also participate in the construction and propagation of colonial
      ideology by providing an implicit justification for British imperialism.
      Colonialism, therefore, appears in these colonial novels not only as the
      literal backdrop for their narrative action, but also as the ideological
      framework that provides the purpouse of the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impact of colonialism, however, is not restricted to the so-called
      colonial, orientalist novels. The nineteenth century's dominant genre of
      domestic fiction is also implicitly informed by colonial ideology. Though
      the novels of writers like Jane Austen, Charlotte Br√∂nte, Charles Dickens,
      and George Eliot focus on domestic British society, Britain's overseas
      possessions frequently play an important role in the action. Thus, Sir
      Thomas Bertram's estate in Mansfield Park is maintained by his possessions
      in Antigua while David Copperfield's Mr. Micawber achieves success in
      Australia and St. John Rivers in Jane Eyre leaves for India to fulfill his
      missionary aspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The implicit presence in these novels of ideas such as the savage nature
      of natives and the white man's burden of bringing civilization to them
      also involves these texts in the dissemination of racial and colonial
      ideologies that provided the conceptual framework for colonialism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though an awareness of the colonial presence in Victorian literature is
      evident in critical studies during the first half of the twentieth
      century, such criticism is usually restricted to an examination of
      colonial novels and an evaluation of the authors' differing attitudes to
      the colonial enterprise as reflected in their writings. It is only in the
      latter half of the twentieth century, in the so-called postcolonial
      period, that critics have explored the pervasive influence of colonial
      ideology throughout nineteenth-century British culture and society.

    <h2>Fun facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fun fact: The reason English no longer has an informal 2nd person
        pronoun is colonialism and the industrial revolution. After the
        invention of the printing press, they started replacing informal 2nd
        person pronouns (thou, thee, thyself) with formal (you, you, yourself)
        because the printing presses couldn't have enough Ts and Hs to be stored
        in an efficient way. After this, informal references were made only
        among illiterate peasants and commonfolk, and as literacy increased
        durring the Industrial Revolution, refering to other literate people as
        "thou" became disresspectful, and slowly fell out of fashion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fun fact: The Queen and her children are the reason most people descened
        from former European royal houses have hereditary Haemophilia.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fun fact: She survived 6 attempts on her life and lived to be the
        longest reigning monarch at the time, dying at 81 years old.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fun fact: She received titles and honours from 16 foreign nations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fun fact: She was the first british monarch to officially recognize
        their frienship with a lowborn person of color.
