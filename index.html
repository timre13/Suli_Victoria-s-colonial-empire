                    During Queen Victoria's reign, the British Empire expanded across the globe and strengthened its
                    title as a world superpower. The main area of colonization for Britain was Africa, which had large
                    amounts of resources that were not being utilized. Specifically, Britain focused on Egypt, West
                    Africa, and South Africa during the nineteenth century. Quicker trade routes, cash crops, and global
                    power were reasons for the quick colonization of these areas. Britain became the undeniable global
                    power and the country experienced major economic growth. However, most people avoided or neglected
                    to think about the effects that colonialism had on the African colonies.

                            The British Empire started expanding in the late 16th century when Elizabeth the Virgin
                            Queen started engaging in Colonialism. One of the most important colonies, through its
                            colonial charter company was the East India Company. When the industrial revolution came
                            around the colonies could be sucked dry of their natural resources with total apathy. The
                            industrial revolution of the 18th century had Britain in a head start and became the richest
                            country for the next 2 centuries. The empire, by Victoria's time, was so huge that some part
                            of it always had the sun and some part always had the moon on the sky at any given time.

                            In the 19th century, Africa became a patchwork of European colonies. Although colonies like
                            Liberia and Sierra Leone were founded by American and British abolitionists as homelands for
                            freed slaves, colonies were mainly set up to exploit the natural resources of the African
                            continent. The Boer War (1899-1902), pitted Britain against Boer colonists for the
                            possession of the interior of South Africa. Less well known is the Ethiopian War (1895-1896)
                            in which the native ruler, Menelik II (1889-1913), defeated an Italian army. Ethiopia was
                            the only African state to remain free of direct colonial control.

                            The British Empire of the 19th century is best known for its queen, Victoria (1837-1901). In
                            British North America, clashes with the United States during the War of 1812 and growing
                            concerns about possible American annexation during the Civil War (1861-1865) led to the
                            creation of the independent Dominion of Canada by Act of Confederation in 1867. Australia
                            was still used as a British penal colony in the first half of the 19th century, but by 1868,
                            shipments of convicts were replaced by free immigrants. In 1901, Australia became an
                            independent commonwealth. Both Canada and Australia are still part of the British
                            Commonwealth as of writing.

                    The decline of the British Empire started in the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup>
                    century. The primary reason for Britain's colonial decline was the loss of supremacy with it's
                    military and navy. After the second World War, Britain was no longer capable of financially
                    supporting its empire as it now had, a legacy of debts and affording an Empire was no longer
                    possible.

                    <p>
                        Just like other industrial societies, British society saw remarkable changes during this period.
                        The Victorian society was divided into the Lower, Working, Middle, and Noble/Ruling classes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cities of the working class saw poor and overcrowded accommodations which lacked sanitation and
                        even the working condition was also unregulated and sometimes dangerous, while a new group,
                        middle class, emerged that included factory owners, proprietors, and businessmen. Most of these
                        men were hardworking and frugal, living in moderate luxuries accessible at that time. This class
                        could read and write as well as afford to buy newspapers, magazines, books and novels. At the
                        bottom of the society were people who were unemployed and lived in slums. Many turned out
                        criminals like pickpockets, thieves and prostitutes.

                <h2>The effects of Colonialism on literature and art</h2>
                <p>
                    The great upsurge of imperial activity during the 19th century, though physically taking place in
                    areas distant from British shores, had a broad impact on British culture. In the view of many
                    critics, irrespective of the direct involvement of individual literary works with the colonial
                    enterprise, the overall contours of Victorian literature are consistently shaped by the influence of
                    colonial ideology, which informed the collective unconscious of the British public during the entire
                    period and effects of it can still be perceived today, especially from Royalists and British
                    nationalists, as well as certain radical political groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most obvious influence of colonialism on Victorian literature is evident in the colonial novels
                    of writers like H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, and Joseph Conrad. These novels are usually set
                    in the distant lands that Britain colonized and attempt to expose the insular domestic public to the
                    exotic strangeness of their country's colonial possessions. The reality of colonialism enters these
                    texts as the necessary background that makes possible their narratives of adventure and romance. The
                    linking of colonialism with the genre of the romantic adventure story is also evident in the
                    abundant children's fiction of the time. While using Britain's colonial enterprise as the setting of
                    their narratives, such novels also participate in the construction and propagation of colonial
                    ideology by providing an implicit justification for British imperialism. Colonialism, therefore,
                    appears in these colonial novels not only as the literal backdrop for their narrative action, but
                    also as the ideological framework that provides the purpouse of the action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The impact of colonialism, however, is not restricted to the so-called colonial, orientalist novels.
                    The nineteenth century's dominant genre of domestic fiction is also implicitly informed by colonial
                    ideology. Though the novels of writers like Jane Austen, Charlotte Br√∂nte, Charles Dickens, and
                    George Eliot focus on domestic British society, Britain's overseas possessions frequently play an
                    important role in the action. Thus, Sir Thomas Bertram's estate in Mansfield Park is maintained by
                    his possessions in Antigua while David Copperfield's Mr. Micawber achieves success in Australia and
                    St. John Rivers in Jane Eyre leaves for India to fulfill his missionary aspirations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The implicit presence in these novels of ideas such as the savage nature of natives and the white
                    man's burden of bringing civilization to them also involves these texts in the dissemination of
                    racial and colonial ideologies that provided the conceptual framework for colonialism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though an awareness of the colonial presence in Victorian literature is evident in critical studies
                    during the first half of the twentieth century, such criticism is usually restricted to an
                    examination of colonial novels and an evaluation of the authors' differing attitudes to the colonial
                    enterprise as reflected in their writings. It is only in the latter half of the twentieth century,
                    in the so-called postcolonial period, that critics have explored the pervasive influence of colonial
                    ideology throughout nineteenth-century British culture and society.

                        Fun fact: The reason English no longer has an informal 2nd person pronoun is colonialism and the
                        industrial revolution. After the invention of the printing press, they started replacing
                        informal 2nd person pronouns (thou, thee, thyself) with formal (you, you, yourself) because the
                        printing presses couldn't have enough Ts and Hs to be stored in an efficient way. After this,
                        informal references were made only among illiterate peasants and commonfolk, and as literacy
                        increased durring the Industrial Revolution, refering to other literate people as "thou" became
                        disresspectful, and slowly fell out of fashion.
