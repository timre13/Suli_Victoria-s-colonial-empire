        <h1>Queen Victoria's British colonialism</h1>
        <h3>
            During Queen Victoria's reign, the British Empire expanded across the globe and strengthened its title as a
            world superpower. The main area of colonization for Britain was Africa, which had large amounts of resources
            that were not being utilized. Specifically, Britain focused on Egypt, West Africa, and South Africa during
            the nineteenth century. Quicker trade routes, cash crops, and global power were reasons for the quick
            colonization of these areas. Britain became the undeniable global power and the country experienced major
            economic growth. However, most people avoided or neglected to think about the effects that colonialism had
            on the African colonies.
        </h3>
        <h2>History of the Empire</h2>
        <p>
            The British Empire started expanding in the late 16th century when Elizabeth the Virgin Queen started
            engaging in Colonialism. One of the most important colonies, through its colonial charter company was the
            East India Company. When the industrial revolution came around the colonies could be sucked dry of their
            natural resources with total apathy. The industrial revolution of the 18th century had Britain in a head
            start and became the richest country for the next 2 centuries. The empire, by Victoria's time, was so huge
            that some part of it always had the sun and some part always had the moon on the sky at any given time.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 19th century, Africa became a patchwork of European colonies. Although colonies like Liberia and
            Sierra Leone were founded by American and British abolitionists as homelands for freed slaves, colonies were
            mainly set up to exploit the natural resources of the African continent. The Boer War (1899-1902), pitted
            Britain against Boer colonists for the possession of the interior of South Africa. Less well known is the
            Ethiopian War (1895-1896) in which the native ruler, Menelik II (1889-1913), defeated an Italian army.
            Ethiopia was the only African state to remain free of direct colonial control.
        </p>
        <p>
            The British Empire of the 19th century is best known for its queen, Victoria (1837-1901). In British North
            America, clashes with the United States during the War of 1812 and growing concerns about possible American
            annexation during the Civil War (1861-1865) led to the creation of the independent Dominion of Canada by Act
            of Confederation in 1867. Australia was still used as a British penal colony in the first half of the 19th
            century, but by 1868, shipments of convicts were replaced by free immigrants. In 1901, Australia became an
            independent commonwealth. Both Canada and Australia are still part of the British Commonwealth as of
            writing.
        </p>
        <h3>
            The decline of the British Empire started in the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The primary
            reason for Britain's colonial decline was the loss of supremacy with it's military and navy. After the
            second World War, Britain was no longer capable of financially supporting its empire as it now had, a legacy
            of debts and affording an Empire was no longer possible.
        </h3>
        <h2>Industrial society</h2>
        <p>
            Just like other industrial societies, British society saw remarkable changes during this period. The
            Victorian society was divided into the Lower, Woring, Middle, and Noble/Ruling classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cities of the working class saw poor and overcrowded accommodations which lacked sanitation and even the
            working condition was also unregulated and sometimes dangerous, while a new group, middle class, emerged
            that included factory owners, proprietors, and businessmen. Most of these men were hardworking and frugal,
            living in moderate luxuries accessible at that time. This class could read and write as well as afford to
            buy newspapers, magazines, books and novels. At the bottom of the society were people who were unemployed
            and lived in slums. Many turned out criminals like pickpockets, thieves and prostitutes.
        </p>
        <h2>The effects of Colonialism on literature and art</h2>
        <p>
            The great upsurge of imperial activity during the 19th century, though physically taking place in areas
            distant from British shores, had a broad impact on British culture. In the view of many critics,
            irrespective of the direct involvement of individual literary works with the colonial enterprise, the
            overall contours of Victorian literature are consistently shaped by the influence of colonial ideology,
            which informed the collective unconscious of the British public during the entire period and effects of it
            can still be perceived today, especially from Royalists and British nationalists, as well as certain radical
            political groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most obvious influence of colonialism on Victorian literature is evident in the colonial novels of
            writers like H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, and Joseph Conrad. These novels are usually set in the
            distant lands that Britain colonized and attempt to expose the insular domestic public to the exotic
            strangeness of their country's colonial possessions. The reality of colonialism enters these texts as the
            necessary background that makes possible their narratives of adventure and romance. The linking of
            colonialism with the genre of the romantic adventure story is also evident in the abundant children's
            fiction of the time. While using Britain's colonial enterprise as the setting of their narratives, such
            novels also participate in the construction and propagation of colonial ideology by providing an implicit
            justification for British imperialism. Colonialism, therefore, appears in these colonial novels not only as
            the literal backdrop for their narrative action, but also as the ideological framework that provides the
            purpouse of the action.
        </p>
        <p>
            The impact of colonialism, however, is not restricted to the so-called colonial, orientalist novels. The
            nineteenth century's dominant genre of domestic fiction is also implicitly informed by colonial ideology.
            Though the novels of writers like Jane Austen, Charlotte Br√∂nte, Charles Dickens, and George Eliot focus on
            domestic British society, Britain's overseas possessions frequently play an important role in the action.
            Thus, Sir Thomas Bertram's estate in Mansfield Park is maintained by his possessions in Antigua while David
            Copperfield's Mr. Micawber achieves success in Australia and St. John Rivers in Jane Eyre leaves for India
            to fulfill his missionary aspirations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The implicit presence in these novels of ideas such as the savage nature of natives and the white man's
            burden of bringing civilization to them also involves these texts in the dissemination of racial and
            colonial ideologies that provided the conceptual framework for colonialism.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though an awareness of the colonial presence in Victorian literature is evident in critical studies during
            the first half of the twentieth century, such criticism is usually restricted to an examination of colonial
            novels and an evaluation of the authors' differing attitudes to the colonial enterprise as reflected in
            their writings. It is only in the latter half of the twentieth century, in the so-called postcolonial
            period, that critics have explored the pervasive influence of colonial ideology throughout
            nineteenth-century British culture and society.

        <li>
            <ul>
                Fun fact: The reason English no longer has an informal 2nd person pronoun is colonialism and the
                industrial revolution. After the invention of the printing press, they started replacing informal 2nd
                person pronouns (thou, thee, thyself) with formal (you, you, yourself) because the printing presses
                couldn't have enough Ts and Hs to be stored in an efficient way. After this, informal references were
                made only among illiterate peasants and commonfolk, and as literacy increased durring the Industrial
                Revolution, refering to other literate people as "thou" became disresspectful, and slowly fell out of
                fashion.
